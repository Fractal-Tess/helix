# For Loops

For loops provide a powerful way to repeat code a specific number of times. They are essential for iterating through arrays and performing repetitive tasks.

## What You'll Learn

- Understanding for loop syntax and structure
- Using for loops with arrays
- Nested for loops for complex patterns
- Loop control statements (break, continue)
- Common for loop patterns and best practices

## Topics Covered

- **For Loop Basics**: Syntax and structure
- **Array Iteration**: Using for loops with arrays
- **Nested Loops**: Multiple levels of iteration
- **Loop Control**: Break and continue statements

## Prerequisites

- Understanding of variables and data types
- Basic knowledge of arrays

Let's master the art of iteration!
