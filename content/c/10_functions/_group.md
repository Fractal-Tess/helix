- Creating and calling functions
- Function parameters and return values
- Function prototypes and declarations
- Scope and lifetime of variables
- Recursive functions

## Topics Covered

- **Function Basics**: Declaration, definition, and calling
- **Parameters and Returns**: Passing data to and from functions
- **Function Prototypes**: Forward declarations
- **Recursion**: Functions that call themselves

## Prerequisites

- Understanding of variables and data types
- Basic knowledge of program structure

Let's master the art of modular programming!
