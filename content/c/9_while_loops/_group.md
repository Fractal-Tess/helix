# While Loops

While loops repeat code as long as a condition is true. They're perfect for situations where you don't know exactly how many iterations you need.

## What You'll Learn

- Understanding while loop syntax and structure
- Using do-while loops for guaranteed execution
- Common while loop patterns and use cases
- Loop control with break and continue
- Avoiding infinite loops

## Topics Covered

- **While Loop Basics**: Syntax and structure
- **Do-While Loops**: Guaranteed execution
- **Common Patterns**: Input validation and counting
- **Loop Control**: Break and continue in while loops

## Prerequisites

- Understanding of for loops
- Basic knowledge of conditions and variables

Let's explore while loops!
