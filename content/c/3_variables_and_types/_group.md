# Variables and Types

Variables are containers that store data in your program. In C, every variable must have a specific data type that determines what kind of data it can store and how much memory it uses.

## What You'll Learn

- Understanding C data types
- Declaring and initializing variables
- Working with integers, characters, and floating-point numbers
- Type modifiers and their effects
- Best practices for variable naming

## Data Types Covered

- **Integers**: `int`, `short`, `long`
- **Characters**: `char`
- **Floating-point**: `float`, `double`
- **Boolean**: `_Bool` (C99)
- **Type modifiers**: `signed`, `unsigned`, `const`

## Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of C program structure
- Knowledge of the compilation process

Let's dive into the world of variables and data types!
